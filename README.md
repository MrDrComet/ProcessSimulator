# ProcessSimulator

Create a simulation with a set number of processors, processes, and pages.

This simulation is then run to showcase two types of algorithms

The Process Scheduler: Choose which process will be run by a certain processor
The Page Replacement: Choose which page to replace with a new page from memory

The Simulation is analyzed by using a Snapshot Object to find the state of the simulation at each time value.

Variables:
Processor #
Process #
Page #
Process Scheduler
Page Replacer

Constants:
Page Frame Size
Page Size
Process/Page Content (Blank)
